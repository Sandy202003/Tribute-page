            <li><span class="bold">Born in 1984, May 14 in New York, America, to psychiatrist Karen and dentist Edward Zuckerberg together with his three sisters.Zuck began using computers and writing software in middle school and built a program that allowed all the computers between his house and his father's office to communicate with each other. He began classes at Harvard in 2002, and already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy". He studied psychology and computer science. In his second year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and help them form study groups.  </span></li>
            <li><span class="bold">Later,together with his roomate, created a different program  called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website and on February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook".He dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year in order to complete the project.</span>
            <li><span class="bold"> Zuckerberg fielded questions during a live Q&A session at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11, 2014. The founder and CEO explained that he does not believe Facebook is a waste of time, because it facilitates social engagement, and participating in a public session was so that he could "learn how to better serve the community".On May 25, 2017, at Harvard's 366th commencement day, Zuckerberg, after giving a commencement speech, received an honorary degree from Harvard. </span></li>
            <li><span class="bold"> In January 2019, Zuckerberg laid plans to integrate an end-to-end encrypted system for three major social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. On August 14, 2020, Facebook integrated the chat systems for Instagram and Messenger on both iOS and Android devices. The update encouraged cross-communication between Instagram and Facebook users</span></li>
